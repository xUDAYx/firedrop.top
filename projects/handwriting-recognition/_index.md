headline : Our project aims to develop a robust handwritten character recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory networks (LSTM). Leveraging the EMNIST dataset, we train and optimize our models to achieve high accuracy in identifying handwritten characters. Additionally, we integrate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for enhanced model interpretability, providing insights into the decision-making process of our deep learning pipeline. This project seeks to advance the field of handwritten character recognition through the application of cutting-edge deep learning techniques."
